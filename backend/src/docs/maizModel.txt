What is Machine Learning: Machine Learning is a subset of Ai where the algorithm learns patterns from a dataset for prediction and decision  making.
There are different types of machine learning: 
    1.Supervised learning : model rely's on labeled data to predict outcomes.
    2.Unsupervised learning: model uses unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns and structures.
    3. Reinforcement learning: Models are trained to make decisions through trail and error, receiving rewards or penalties for their actions.

Training a image detection model it's likely that one will rely on (CNN tensorflowjs).

How to create a model: 
    1.Define the problem
    2.prepare and collect data
    3.Future engineering - thouroughly polish the data for better learning
    4.Create/train model
    5.Monitor models perfomance: highlight losses and accuracy are they perfect?

Below is a simple model created for detecting maize crop diseases:
    *step one the proble: A model for detecting crop diseases
    *step two data collection/preperation: collect different variety of both maize crop, maize crops with diseases etc.
        maizedata.json {
            maize: [
                different maize images here
            ],
            bipolaris: [
                different maize images with bipolaris disease
            ],
            head-smut: [
                different maize images with head smut disease
            ],
            leathal-cecrosis: [
                different maize images with leathal cecrosis disease
            ]
        }
    *step three future engineering: pre-check the data provided for better model learning refine it if possible
    *create/train the model on the data collected
    *Monitor based on your data is the model prediction accurate or off ? if off adjust the model or the data tha was collected.
